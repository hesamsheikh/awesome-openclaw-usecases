# Market Research & Product Factory

You want to build a product but don't know what to build. Or you have a business and need to understand what your customers are struggling with. This workflow uses the Last 30 Days skill to mine Reddit and X for real pain points, then has OpenClaw build solutions to those problems.

## What It Does

- Researches any topic across Reddit and X over the last 30 days using the [Last 30 Days](https://github.com/matvanhorde/last-30-days) skill
- Surfaces real challenges, complaints, and feature requests people are posting about
- Helps you identify product opportunities from genuine user pain points
- Takes it a step further: ask OpenClaw to build an MVP that solves one of those challenges
- Creates a full research-to-product pipeline with zero coding on your part

## Pain Point

Most aspiring entrepreneurs struggle with the "what to build" problem. Market research traditionally means hours of manual browsing through forums, social media, and review sites. This automates the entire discovery-to-prototype pipeline.

## Skills You Need

- [Last 30 Days](https://github.com/matvanhorde/last-30-days) skill by Matt Van Horde

## How to Set It Up

1. Install the Last 30 Days skill:

```

2. Run research on any topic:
```text
Please use the Last 30 Days skill to research challenges people are
having with [your topic here].

Organize the findings into:

```

3. Pick a pain point and have OpenClaw build a solution:
```text

Keep it simple — just the core functionality.
Ship it as a web app I can share with people.
```

4. For ongoing market intelligence, schedule regular research:
```text

people are saying about [your niche] on Reddit and X. Summarize the
top opportunities and send them to my Telegram.
```

## Real World Example

```text
"Use the Last 30 Days skill to research challenges people are having with OpenClaw."

Results:
- Setup difficulty: Many users struggle with initial configuration
- Skill discovery: People can't find skills that do what they need

→ "Build me a simple web app that makes OpenClaw setup easier with a guided wizard."

OpenClaw builds the app. You ship it. You have a product.
```
